I watched a guy install our internet (probably 1996). He installed the modem and showed me how to get online. He also showed me IRC. He logged on and went into a chat room and he told me that I could use this to talk to people all over the world. He logged in using my name. He said Hello and showed me how to make a smiley face by typing :-). Then he said you can hug people by putting their name surrounded by a lot of parenthesis because it was like a big hug. He demonstrated by hugging someone he knew in IRC and I felt embarrassed because my name was hugging someone I didn't even know. I was glad he showed me how to get online in the browser but I never used IRC after that because I didn't want to run into someone he hugged under my name.
