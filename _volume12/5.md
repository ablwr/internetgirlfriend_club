I kind of knew what that meant — I could picture a family sitting down and talking seriously as a group, it just wouldn’t be my family. My mom must have felt similar as she walked into the living room and said "we don't have family meetings". It was almost under her breath, to herself; she sounded astonished. I can’t imagine the things she might have suspected forced our family to become a Family Meeting family.

My dad was already there, having been the person to call our inaugural meeting. My sibling looked annoyed. There was also the hidden message in their look that only I would understand: it was my fault that they were annoyed right now. When we were all there, my dad summarized the hour-long call he had with AOL support, told us all why our accounts were locked.

“Someone with a screen name in our account went into a chatroom and said ‘yo bitches’”
