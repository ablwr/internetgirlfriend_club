Dear Ryan,  
Hello there! How are you doing? I thought I'd drop you a line and see if college
is still as wonderful as you say. Nice hairdo by the way. I hope you're
enjoying everything!  
  


Ok...now down to my truly selfish motive for sending you this e-mail. I saw a
clip of a movie in my psychology class that was so warped, I figured few could
interpret it. Naturally, I figured you to be one of the few. I myself have the
unfortunate inability to be able to take your "unique" view of things.
So...here it goes...have you ever seen "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas?" Holy
shit. That is the most fucked up movie I have ever seen. I mean...I spent so
much time trying to get it to make sense that I think I may have lasting side
effects! We were discussing altered states of consciousness and let me tell
you, even the stoners in my class didn't get this one. I would try to explain
it, but that would be an exercise in futility. All I can say is that two guys
who are flyin on everything conceivable rent a car and go to Las Vegas.
Anyway, if you have seen this movie, could you please tell me WHAT THE HELL IT
MEANS?! If not, I think you should seriously consider renting it. I think you
would find it quite funny. Come to think of it, you might find it even funnier
if you were to watch it with someone who is the complete antithesis of
yourself. You know...uptight, goodie-two shoes, don't drink, don't smoke,
waaaay to Christian type? That would be interesting.  
  


Anyway, I'll stop typing now as you probably quit reading this a long time ago
anyway. But if you happen to check this out, just let me know. No hurry, I'm
just interested in what you think  
  

  
Hope things are going well over there,  
-- Ally :-)
