When I was in high school, I was friends with this guy Cody. Cody was 2 or 3 years younger than me and played bass in my other friends band. We went to different high schools. I guess Cody was still in middle school so we didn't go to the same school anyway. I would talk to Cody a lot on AIM. He told me he had a crush on a girl at his school. Danielle, and he wanted to ask her out. Danielle was on AIM too. So I messaged Danielle, trying to be Cody's lady wingman or something.

Danielle was nice and we would chat, and I was slowly building up to ask her about Cody and what she thought of him, trying to figure out if my friend was going to get his heart crushed into 100 pieces or if they would live happily ever after. Danielle was easy to talk to but I could not read where she was at on this, and I was 14 or 15 so I don't think I was being coy or clever or anything. She kept dodging the question so I thought she probably did like him and just did not want to tell a stranger on the internet. We did hang out once in person though.

So anyway this goes on for a few weeks or months... I don't really know because time is weird when you are still a young person. Cody is still wondering what to do and he would send me a lot of stressed out old skool emoji like x_x or <____< because he was getting desperate. I guess they don't have prom when you are in middle school but maybe there is something like that.

So I try again with Danielle. Danielle trusts me by this point, and maybe even trusts me more than Cody since I am like an internet person and not like a school person. So this time she tells me the truth. She says "okay you have to promise not to tell anyone this."

Entrigue! I am loving it. I forgot all about Cody's heart... I was ready for the drama. She said okay, I am already dating someone, but online. I was like okay, that's cool, so you are not available. Then she said, I'm dating a woman and we are in love. I was like oh that's really cool, good for you I am happy for you. Then she also said that she was like a type of furry. I had to google types of furries and I guess I'm supposed to say fursona. Anyway her fursona was like a husky wolf. I don't remember exactly but I remember it was extremely specific, like not just any dog or wolf but a specific kind. I was like ok cool I respect your decision or whatever.

Then I remembered Cody so I didn't know what to do and I don't think Danielle knew either because she told me if anyone at her school found out she was a lesbian, she would be in trouble because it was a conservative area. She seemed more worried about that than being a furry, Iguess because being a furry was so far out there that no one would even know what to do with it. 


Anyway yeah that's my story I don't really have an ending. I never told Cody. I kept my promise to Danielle and I hope she is living a super lesbian furry dog wolf life somewhere.
