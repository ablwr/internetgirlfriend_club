*Author's notes: This isn't mine, but a friend of mine placed a personal ad on a BDSM message board (I guess?) when we were 16 and she sent me one of the responses. I don't think she replied.*

**Title:** Ok this is a lil too scary  

This is the second response from a guy commenting on my personal ad..

*I greet thee my servant!!! How art thou my fair maiden?? I am here my entrancing maiden...............and let me warn you instantly of what you have found, for this Dark Master and Vampire is precisely what your soul has sought for an eternity for and now I am in front of you waiting for you to grasp and submit completely to my eternal hold........you see, I possess very powerful Vampiric instincts and intuition.*

![vamp](/assets/img/vamp10.gif){: .left}

*It matters not of the age of your mortal body my maiden, or even your external appearence, for it is what is inside your soul that will always attract me to a fair maiden, and that is where your REAL beauty lies, and that is eternal.*

![vamp](/assets/img/vamp13.gif){: .right}

*Tell me more of you my fair maiden as I demand to know every detail of my fair maiden. How is your life in South Carolina my fair maiden?? Are you totally free and single or have you been entranced by the plethora or replies you must have received to your ad?? I will tell you more about this Dark Master my maiden.......*

![vamp](/assets/img/vamp9.gif){: .left}

*I seek my one true soulmate maiden.........and she would be the type that is a true hopeless romantic, a creative dark soul, a deep inner spirit filled with beauty yet left with a dark hole longing to be filled by this Dark Prince of Darkness. She must be creative, extremely passionate, loyal and very devoted for this Count will never share his maiden, even in writing.*

![vamp](/assets/img/vamp15.jpg){: .right}

*She must be intelligent, open and honest, very spiritual, very submissive, and one maiden who is not afraid to fall head over heels madly in love with me, despite even this distance or time apart, for she knows that we will be together for all eternity and nothing and no-one will keep us apart again. Are you such a maiden and romantic my sweet lass??*

![vamp](/assets/img/vamp2.gif){: .left}

*Something tells me, that deep down inside, you are indeed such a lass, but you tend now to show too many people that side of you. You see my fair maiden, this Dark Lord is not one for idle conversation, or simple pen-pal discussions.....the maiden I choose to continue a correspondence, will be one where we already possess a certain chemistry and connection that pulls us together, and one that we dare not ignore. A connection of the soul that can even be felt from our first letters to each other, and I believe you have already felt it!!*

![vamp](/assets/img/vamp11.gif){: .right}

*And my maiden must crave more than anything to be with this Dark Vampire in person and be with me wherever I go. You must remain at my side for all time to in eternal bliss and darkness. So if you are simply seeking a DArk Lord to write to, then I am not for you. So tell me NOW!!! Let me tell you more about me my fair maiden, and hope that it stirrs a deep sensation from within your soul, an awakening of your heart that pulses sooo intensely that you shudder from it's force.*

![vamp](/assets/img/vamp12.gif){: .left}

*A true Vampire is very solitary, and secluded, and will remain so until their soul, spirit and body has united with another...........I prowl alone in this world and have always done so during all my lifetimes in various decaying mortal bodies. I take what I need and have fed off many fair maidens when I hunger.*

*However, I reveal myself and my dark inner secrets to no curiosity-seeker, or pretender who can never become what their mortal fantasies dream of. I am an experienced Vampire of many centuries, and seek to teach my maiden to entwine in my Vampiric dark ways and also to travel to far and mystical lands, as well as to feed upon her........so you must be my donor as well as my maiden.*

![vamp](/assets/img/vamp8.gif){: .right}

*I seek a donor maiden to feed upon and use at will.....so I hope your neck is pale and tasty!!! Where you reside is not important, I will find you and take you if you are right for my tastes. Another warning though my delectable maiden, a Vampiric passionate kiss from this dark soul, and you will belong to me for all eternity........you will crave my body and soul and long to be at my side, where I will take you and keep you.*

![vamp](/assets/img/vamp6.gif){: .left}

*You will remain with me in dark bliss and tranquility. Although ones age in this decaying body and external appearence and material things matters not to me my maiden, I will provide you an accurate description of me which I hope will arouse your passions and desires: I am 6ft tall, with jet black hair, dark brown hypnotic eyes, and a dark brown complexion. I'm very slim built. I was born and raised in olde London, England, but many generations ago, my ancestors derived from mystic India, Asia........alot of my mystical nature, and very dark features and complexion comes from there.*

![vamp](/assets/img/vamp14.jpg){: .right}

*I adore music and play in a band part-time purely for fun and my love for music. I also love all things artistic and creative that can stimulate my mind. I seek a fair maiden too, that can stimulate my mind, as well as fulfill my hunger for passion and lust and submit to all my many erotic desires for Vampires are the most passionate creatures on Earth.......and I crave passion in all it's forms.*

 ![vamp](/assets/img/vamp7.gif){: .left}

*I believe trust and communication and passion are most important in relationships and with me they are demanded!! My band is gothic/alternative with ambient overtones.......wierd yes, but I like to be different and unique in all that I do. I adore all types of music and artistic creativity, but my favourite music, is gothic, alternative, rock, classical, folk, trance, techno, ambient, progressive. So, as you can see, I write poetry and songs aplenty.*

![vamp](/assets/img/vamp3.gif){: .left}

 *If you are still interested my maiden, then I desire us to stay in frequent communication with each other, and we will talk over the phone where I will mermerize, seduce and ravish you with my deep hypnotic voice, until our desires and hunger are such that we have to meet in person. That is who I am and what I seek my enchanting dark maiden. I seek not a maiden whom I will email with at pleasure........*

![vamp](/assets/img/vamp4.gif){: .right}

 *I am real, and seek your flesh as well as your soul and your life itself to share in for all eternity. Now write me maiden and tell me more about you, especially your real true dark persona, and make your replies long, deep and personal for I demand it!!!*

![vamp](/assets/img/vamp5.gif){: .center}


*Vampire kisses all over your neck, I suck hungrily, kissing into your neck deeply, and feeding from you, until you collaspe into my arms in complete and utter ecstasy........you belong to me for all eternity*

**Count Anthony**
