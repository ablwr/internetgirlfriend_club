I don't really think of this as a story. More like a check mark on a list titled "awkward situations enabled by teenagers on the internet." A few paragraphs to build up to a likely anti-climatic reaction of "huh, that happened" but with the redeeming knowledge that only a mixture of mid-90's teens, 56k modems and IRC could have enabled it.

In 1996 I was around fourteen or fifteen, I think a common period of social transition. In my school system going from middle school (6-8th) to high school (9-12th). A time when your friends often turn out not really to be your friends and your real friends are still in the future. But I had the internet and IRC, I was on [EFnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFnet), or maybe [DALnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalnet), or was it [Undernet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undernet)? Like a lot of details in this story I can't remember anymore.

But IRC was different. Back then there were earnestly channels called #TeenChat, with real (probably) teens chatting in them. But why would I want to be in a channel without Ops, or at least Voice? So like moving to another lunch table in the cafeteria people would make new better channels with original names like #TeenChat5 or #TeenChat8. And once these new territories were created you had to keep them, being vigilant against net splits and impostors with their mIRC scripts to de-Op your comrades. Maybe you knew someone who knew someone with an [eggdrop](http://www.eggheads.org/) bot and your channel could be super legit.

If none of that made sense good, you did not spend any of your life in a digital ‘Lord of the Flies’-esque territory. The point being as in real life strangers get put together and often become friends and form a community. My community had maybe a dozen or so regulars, people on-line for multiple hours a day.

For whatever reason people began to pair up, couples were forming, I remember people saying the words "internet boy/girlfriend" and honestly thinking how stupid it was. There were real life girls I desperately wished would speak to me, girls I could physically see. But when a girl (probably) in the channel showed interest in me my high horse was nowhere to be found.


It was a simulacrum of a relationship. So fake I can't even remember her name, maybe started with the letter J (probably not). But what I do vividly remember is a private message I received a few weeks later:

`"Are you Jxxxx internet boyfriend"`  
`"yeah, i guess so"`  
`"I'm her real life boyfriend"`  
`"oh..."`  


Lots of insults followed focusing on me being pathetic, a loser, etc. I didn't even ignore him, I chatted and answered any questions he had. To me this drama was as fake as the relationship and I filed it away in a minimized [mIRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIRC) window.

I don't think I talked to her much after that and the channel itself eventually died out. As I said, my teenage experience with fake (fake) internet love was mostly anti-climatic. But I do thoroughly appreciate my strongest internet girlfriend memory is another guy.
