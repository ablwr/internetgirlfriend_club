🎃 Oh! Welcome! To a sp *o* o *oO* O *Oo* oo *o* oky edition of ~\**Internet Girlfriend Club*\*~!! I'm so happy to have made it to Volume 3 on a per-monthly basis and am already looking forward to continuing with Volume 4 next month (in which I promise to give an embarrassing part of myself to you, readers). [Contribute](/cfp)!!!  
<br/>

In anticipation of the **ʎɐpᴉloɥ**, this volume contains many **TREATS** arriving to greet us in corporeal form as primary sources, including a one-sided [AIM](/volume3/6.html) (RIP) chat log and three(!) from early-2000s Livejournal: [teen goth interests](/volume3/2.html), [a visual excerpt](/volume3/5.html), and [a full excerpt](/volume3/4.html). Rare treats! The [first chapter](/volume3/1.html) in this Volume is a long and passionate email sent from a self-described [vampire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k38Vm4EwYlM) to a 15-year-old looking for romance, which was later sent to me. In the middle of the Volume, [Chapter 3](/volume3/3.html), we also have a strong personal narrative, perhaps better understood as a horror story, from someone who is probably happy that [AIM is dead](https://twitter.com/aim/status/916290747850264577). May it never become [undead, undead, undead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-o39BJ0Aww).
