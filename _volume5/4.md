*Author's note: I was really into mixtape swapping in the early 2000s (even if they were usually cd-rs), on message boards and livejournal. I found this playlist on an old back up drive and it was from like 2002. It is sooooooo 2002. this must have been like 2 or 3 cds though. I don't think I made it for an internet boyfriend or anything but mixtapes are always kinda inherently romantic right?*  
*Editor's note: I made a Spotify playlist [here](https://open.spotify.com/embed/user/1210200191/playlist/45qxFRw7snspV1zM2YamV3) or embedded below. Enjoy!*
