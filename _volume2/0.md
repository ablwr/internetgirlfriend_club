Volume 2 of Internet Girlfriend Club is here and (at the risk of being very gender-essentialist, forgive me), this volume is all about **[BOYS BOYS BOYS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPRy1B4t5YA)**!!! Chapters include...

* [crucial life lessons learned from reflecting on unrequited teen love](/volume2/1.html) (I found this story to be so perfect and compelling),  
* [spending the summer golfing and on the computer](/volume2/2.html) (primo scanned primary source material!),  
* [a meandering email to a friend](/volume2/3.html) (recovered from digital to physical back to digital), and  
* [a beautiful, accurate, dramatic 3-part series](/volume2/4.html) of journal entries featuring a rollercoaster of emotions over a 48-hour period. I think we've all been there; I know I have. Honestly, I feel this way about every narrative that has come my way via this project (represented, unrepresented, or yet-to-be-presented) and others have told me the same.

ðŸš¨ Reminder! ðŸš¨ ðŸš¨  I rely on you, dear readers, to feed me with more stories! If you know me IRL and have talked to me about this AFK, you've seen the frenzied but focused look in my eyes, the potentially-almost-literally frothing-at-the-mouth enthusiasm, hungry for [MORE MORE MORE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfIWMH7FBQ8). Share the [CFP](/cfp) with others, beg your friends to contribute (as I have been doing, essentially non-stop), cold-email your long-lost internet friends and beg them to write about you! More short snippets of chat logs are welcome, too! They are rare delights.

Give it up for [THE BOYS, THE BOYS](https://youtu.be/c0AFtDl0U-A?t=23s)!
