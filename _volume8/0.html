Continuing on [last volume](/volume7/0.html)'s theme, here are a few more examples of the pre-Y2K internet, full of [passionate declarations](/volume8/1.html) and creative usernames, of [personal connections across wires](/volume8/2.html), of [starting new adventures](/volume8/3.html) and [resolving old ones](/volume8/4.html), and of [seeking new friends](/volume8/6.html) and [reflecting on old ones](/volume8/5.html). This volume is heavy on the [Lycos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lycos)-owned sites that acted as portals for many people to express themselves on the web. 

[Submissions open](/cfp)! Regular programming will return for Volume 9, but only with **your** stories!

Love,

Ashley
