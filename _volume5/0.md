Hello! 

Welcome to Volume V of Internet Girlfriend Club. Hmm, I think the major themes of this volume are serious [ROCKIN'](/volume5/1.html) and [ROLLING](/volume5/4.html) and serious reflections on the [fleeting significant moments](/volume5/5.html) in [our lives](/volume5/2.html) and [other people's lives](/volume5/3.html). This volume really relishes in youthfulness, even the awkward parts. Regarding platforms, we have [BBS](/volume5/2.html), [blogging](/volume5/1.html), [AIM](/volume5/5.html), [Furcadia](/volume5/3.html) and [optical media via physical mail](/volume5/4.html) (I assume).  Also, I can't believe it took until Chapter 5 for [furries](/volume5/3.html) to make their appearance in this web-zine. And we truly haven't had enough [teen heartthrobs](/volume5/5.html), so I'm very happy that has been rectified.

[Chapter 4](/volume5/4.html), you'll see, features a playlist. If you read these volumes in bulk and want to bop along to the sweet sounds of 2002, you can preemptively load it up on Spotify [here](https://open.spotify.com/embed/user/1210200191/playlist/45qxFRw7snspV1zM2YamV3). This is pretty much exactly what I was downloading on [SoulSeek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soulseek) and ['scrobbling](http://web.archive.org/web/20030328192917/http://www.audioscrobbler.com:80/) in the early 2000s. Although, for [Chapter 3](/volume5/3.html), maybe [this jam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uERIXLWeik0) is better-suiting.

The [last chapter](/volume5/6.html) came to my inbox mysteriously (via [the anonymous submission form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeUqrFZoeRduZqeyEQsAPUoXb7SddRmQ2XmalXkym_29-P2gw/viewform)) and I'm curious if we'll see the story continue. If you sent this in and you are reading this: I want to know! We want to know!  

I'd really like to hear some narratives based around NeoPets or DeviantArt! Do you have anything or know anyone? The [CFP](/cfp) is always open!

Your editor, Ashley
