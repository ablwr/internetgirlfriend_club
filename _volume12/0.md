Hello and welcome to Volume 12 of 🅸🅽🆃🅴🆁🅽🅴🆃 🅶🅸🆁🅻🅵🆁🅸🅴🅽🅳 🅲🅻🆄🅱!
  
As always, it's a joy to put this together. I think we have a really broad mix of contributions this time around, [a](https://internetgirlfriend.club/volume12/6.html) - [lot](https://internetgirlfriend.club/volume12/5.html) - [of](https://internetgirlfriend.club/volume12/3.html) - [narratives](https://internetgirlfriend.club/volume12/1.html), one [short chat log](https://internetgirlfriend.club/volume12/2.html), and our very first [poem](https://internetgirlfriend.club/volume12/4.html)!!!

We cover a big range of platforms in this volume. In order: [NationStates](https://www.nationstates.net/), MSN Messenger, e-mail, Club Penguin, AOL, and IRC. NationStates and Club Penguin are new platforms to the zine's milieu. Thank you, authors, for adding these new narratives.

For those seeking larger internet girlfriend club content in audio form, Joanne McNeil has launched a [podcast about MySpace](https://link.chtbl.com/storyofmyspace), UnderUnderStood [asks about Disney's Virtual Magic Kingdom](https://underunderstood.com/podcast/episode/what-happened-to-disney-vmk/), and Endless Thread has a real [Canadian internet girlfriend](https://www.wbur.org/endlessthread/2023/02/10/my-canadian-girlfriend) story. Guess the early internet vibes are just all in the air right now.

This may be the final volume, I'm not sure yet. The only way to guarantee that we get to Volume 13 is [six more contributions](http://localhost:4000/cfp/)! I know it's hard, it makes you cringe and want to cry and throw up thinking about your dark past, but _please_ cast that aside, submit anonymously (as MANY authors in this bundle have done), and help bring more early web stories (good or bad) to the wider world web.

Your editor, Ashley
