*Author's note: In the spring of 2004 I had an internet girlfriend. We met at such and such small liberal arts college but only began “dating” shortly after she took leave back home, out of state for a semester. I was ecstatic; my heart soared with hope for the future, with each surprise visit that she made from hundreds of miles away. I was also depressed; mired deep in a depression that demands and exacerbates loneliness in spite of or probably even just because of real feelings of affirmation and companionship. She knew this kind of tension better than I’d thought. The drama (love! sex! secrets! and a surprise twist!) played out over dozens of late night/early morning AOL Instant Messenger chats. What follow are two that I think capture the experience. Names and screen names were changed.*

**Potsdamerplatz33:** see how awesome you are? where else could a guy like me hear that?  
**FioFio5:** a guy like you? you're exactly the kind of guy a girl would want to run to. you deserve it.  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** someone else said that to me the other night. "you deserve it." i must have done some great things in my life to deserve all this.  
**FioFio5:** who said that?  
**FioFio5:** and in what context?  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** andrew. when i was fawning over you to him.  
**FioFio5:** you're just fantastic and honest and real and unique and intelligent and talented with a whole lot of bad times in your past... of course you deserve wonderful things  
**FioFio5:** aw  
**FioFio5:** that was sweet of him  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** well i'm glad i can get past all that shit with you and not alone  
**FioFio5:** you've been fawning??  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** heheheehehehehe3  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** um, 3  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** that means yes  
**FioFio5:** haha  
**FioFio5:** I have plenty of stuff that's not far behind me myself... it's good to have someone who can understand what it's like to not be peachy all the time  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** yeah  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** i want you to remember something  
**FioFio5:** yes?  
![bar](/assets/img/heartline2.gif){: .center} 
**Potsdamerplatz33:** i know that i'm a pretty depressed person all around. and i'm workin on that, but its gonna take time. and in that time i hope that when i'm sad or mopey or whatever, you dont take it personally. it could never be your fault or your responsibility to take care of everything  
**FioFio5:** I know that all too well  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** good  
**FioFio5:** just know that I can empathize with a lot of how you might feel... so feel free to talk with me about anything (and I will   with you), because I know how it goes. I'm not going to be a fair-weather girlfriend... I'll weather it all.  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** thank you  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** this is why its so easy to love you  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** well its one of the reasons  
**FioFio5:** :-)  
**FioFio5:** what's another reason? (yes, this is called "fishing for compliments  
**FioFio5:** "  
**FioFio5:** )  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** youre very thoughtful  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** i mean, the gifts and all?  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** spontaneous  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** coming down here and suprising me  
**FioFio5:** life would be soooooo dull without spontaneity  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** not to mention stunningly beautiful  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** true  
**FioFio5:** I can't help but think that your opinion of me is just a tad bit skewed by your rose-colored glasses  
**FioFio5:** ;-)  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** no way! youre absurdly sweet. i don't know how you keep it up.  
**FioFio5:** I yam what I yam  
**FioFio5:** you're sure one to talk though  
**FioFio5:** you're incredibly expressive when it comes to how you feel and what you're thinking  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** i try my best  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** sometimes i feel i could do more though  
**FioFio5:** more??  
**FioFio5:** is that possible?  
**FioFio5:** I think you're FANTASTIC  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** thank you baby  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** you make me feel fantastic  
**FioFio5:** you know  
**FioFio5:** I've always thought "baby" was a silly petname, and never understood why people used it. But for some reason, when you say it, I just smile and get all warm and fuzzy,  
**FioFio5:** .  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** awesome  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** i mean, its not as good as a real pet name, but sometimes its just what comes to mind  
**FioFio5:** mmmhmmm  
**FioFio5:** so....  
**FioFio5:** people around campus are saying that you're like a totally different person  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** hahahaha  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** yeah i guess so  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** people like who?  
**FioFio5:** no one  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** ????  
**FioFio5:** they say you're happy  
**FioFio5:** and you smile  
**FioFio5:** and laugh

**FioFio5:** when they get up to your shoulders, I lean in, letting my breath mingle with yours and my hair brush your cheek  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** oo  
**FioFio5:** you try to strain up to catch a kiss, but I move away and press my lips in a series of kisses along the hairline at your   temple  
**FioFio5:** your right temple, that is  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** gotchs  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** a
