Hello! 

After more than a **2-year hiatus**, Internet Girlfriend Club is finally here with a new volume. Welcome ... at long, long last ... to Volume 9!

I didn't forget about this site! Although I will admit that at times I worried I would have to end up writing a ["goodbye statement"](https://twitter.com/search?q=%40gifmodel%20take%20your%20time&src=typed_query) on the front page. It's not from a lack of wanting, because I get a lot of joy from working on this zine. But it requires a specific effort and skillset to repeatedly aks for contributions from friends, friend-of-friends, and strangers that I found, for a myriad of mundane reasons, to be especially challenging in 2019-2020.

I did work on a few similar projects in the meantime. I gave a talk and wrote about how video used to live on the web and [what to do about it now](https://bits.ashleyblewer.com/blog/2019/04/20/rhondas-greatest-hits-bastard-film-encounter/). I created a network-based performance art project, called [Throttled](https://ashleyblewer.com/throttled.html) (and there's a [blog post](https://bits.ashleyblewer.com/blog/2020/05/13/throttled-a-few-things-i-learned-making-this-network-based-performance/) about it, too, if you want a more technical perspective). And recently (assuming we have been in March for the past 8 months), I wrote about MTV's foray into the virtual worlds community in 1996 for [Screen Slate](https://screenslate.com/), with a copy you can read [here](https://bits.ashleyblewer.com/blog/2020/11/16/enter-the-tikkiland-mtv-spring-break-online/).

**Ashley, this isn't LiveJournal -- what about Volume 9???**

That's right. Volume 9 follows a general theme of *communal computing*. (Excluding the first story, which is more about of the traditional middle/high school antics, except (very) online.) I probably have a dozen stories where having a shared "family" computer got me in [trouble](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojp71GGm-LQ) (cookies, crashes, messages meant for me and NOT my dad, my little brother's friend downloading porn and getting a virus...) 

For the [majority of North Americans today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YaF_dx6WhE), the idea of having to share a phone and computer with your entire family sounds like a total nightmare (Isn't Facebook bad enough?). 

This volume contains [exploiting autodialers for love](/volume9/3.html), a sweet little [love letter to the internet itself](/volume9/2.html) (and some sneaky shoulder-surfing), sharing computers and computer space with [fellow library patrons](/volume9/4.html), a mom [speculating](/volume9/5.html) on who is on the other end of the internet (and phone), and church pastors getting a taste for [how educational the internet can be sometimes](/volume9/6.html).

This volume has furries, this volume has hentai, this volume has [Gatorade Frost Arctic Breeze](https://www.gatorade.com/hydration/thirst-quencher), this volume has pyramid schemes. Really, this volume has it all.

(Except primary sources! This volume features a full suite of narratives.)

Finally, like always, please [submit snippets of your past](/cfp) for future editions, so we can have another volume before 2022! (although I have a feeling it might be just around the corner..!)

Your editor, Ashley
