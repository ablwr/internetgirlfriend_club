## What turns me on

   * HOMEPAGES

       * Download time - This is important. Stalling can cause interest to wane. Know what I mean, jellybean...
       * Theme - Get one and stick with it.
       * Originality - Don't bite.



   * HEARTS

       * good-nature, compassion, innate appeal
       either you have it or you don't.



   * HUMOR

       * Great therapy. If you lack a sense of humor you won't understand this, my way of thinking...or me. You suck.
       * Just knowing where to draw the line, what's cool or not so cool. If you aren't some ignorant lil shit, you don't have to worry about this stuff.
       * Make me laugh and you've got my attention. Leave me speechlessand dammmn. It hasn't happened, so who knows? :) ..k, so maybe it did happen. once.
