*Freezone.com was a website meant for kids founded in the mid-'90s in Seattle, with a [charismatic zine-aesthetic](http://web.archive.org/web/19961129021632/http://freezone.com:80/) prevalent on the web at the time and kid-targeted information articles about music and movies, quizzes, [HTML learning guides](http://web.archive.org/web/19981205135556/http://freezone.com:80/brain/) and an advice column. It allowed kids to participate directly on the site, live, with bulletin boards, chat rooms, and ePals connector. Unlike other parts of the web, Freezone was actively monitored by adults, [this news article](https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=119448&page=1) implying that these monitoring services cost the company up to $100,000 a year. But kids asking other kids to be their internet girlfriends or boyfriends were fair game in the ePals page, as you'll see in the chaos below.*

<hr/>

Bulletin Board: meet cyber-friends here!  

Some helpful hints:  

    * Read all the subject headings before you start a new topic.
    * To respond to a post, click on the "respond" button (yes, it's that easy!).
    * Remember, all posts are screened, so no inappropriate messages will be posted.
    * Make sure you post your message in the right place. If you post a message in the wrong area, it will not be posted. For example, a "Cyber-friend wanted" topic will not be posted in Action, which is supposed to be about sports, travel, and adventure. 

But wait! I need instructions
