Press your D.  
no, not that one  
Your ‘D to Dance’.  
Then we’ll get some.  
You feel that groove?  
You wear the hat?  
Return to your favourite spot just where ya sat.  
Now stop.  
Make eye contact.  
Yeah, him, or her, just anyone. Quick! They see  
you – now  
Scoop me  
C a r e  
F u l l y  
Do it: press ‘T –  
\- to throw a snow  
Ball’. For me? Why, thanks!  
I’ll go... But you have to come get me  
I know I’m second place  
To the ace everyone goes to Club with  
I’m just nIce, I’m just cool, I’m just a secret to  
the newly joined fools  
But then they’ll be told by those who know  
about me. Then they’ll all come and go.  
Never staying longer  
Unless I put on a freebie or a festival show.  
They berg and barg-  
ain, again, and again  
about who’ll be first to tip me  
To go deep and take my pearls,  
taped-on pride like teenage virginity  
But they’ll spend it on other things  
and with everyone, back for the same and more  
Even though everybody seas  
I’m just forgotten ashore  
So fuck em. I’ll never change.  
I’ll stay the same, let them all play their game.  
Gonna try to tip me over? Is that all they got?  
Try harder, soon I’m gonna be turned off.  
  
But for now, away from everyone  
I think it’s just you and me  
Come sit down, scoot over, massage my back  
Show your love, do your D ance. Make me sea.  
  
<small>In 2005, the [“Iceberg”](https://clubpenguin.fandom.com/wiki/Iceberg) was introduced to players of the Massively  
Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game Club Penguin (2005-  
2017)    as a room accessible only by clicking on its icon in the  
game map. While the room is one of the oldest, its appearance  
and room-specific interactions between players has remained  
unchanged throughout the years. Penguins either visited the  
room to play the “Aqua Grabber” minigame for coins, or en  
masse to ‘tip the Iceberg’ by equipping their hard hat helmets  
while standing on one side of the berg. Despite its status as a  
.jpeg file, penguins constantly tried to animate the Iceberg into  
being tipped over. It was persistent; all day and every day. This  
poem was written in memory of the room, but more so, as a  
reflection on how the Iceberg may have felt about this decade-  
long relationship it had with players, dating all the way back to  
2005.</small>
