Hey hey! Volume 6!

We have some extreme treats here. We have both [flappers](/volume6/1.html) and [scene kids](/volume6/6.html) (I'm gonna be listening to [Designing a Nervous Breakdown](https://open.spotify.com/album/42fsY10FqhlkSbkJA4lUCJ?si=FijWB0l6Sb2ChIGKeOJCTQ) all night). We also have [sweet sweet (seriously sweet) romance](/volume6/3.html), [questionable interpretations of librarianship](/volume6/2.html), [ugh, drama](/volume6/5.html) and [learning to be a better person thanks to strangers on livejournal](/volume6/4.html).

I am really really excited to have another [interview-style](/volume6/3.html) entry (just like the [first entry in the very first volume](/volume1/1.html)) and also very very very excited to have a ["mixed media" piece](/volume6/4.html) featuring some illustrations of livejournal memories.

The next two (maybe three) volumes may arrive sooner but also be a little different, but I hope you enjoy them all the same. Please keep sending me things and encourage your friends to tell me their internet secrets!

Hope you enjoy as much as I do! I am overjoyed every time I receive a surprise new peek into early internet history.

Your loving editor, Ashley
