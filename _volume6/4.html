College, and my first cable internet connection, provided me a glimpse into a world much more colorful than my po-dunk suburban upbringing could have prepared me for. Outside the modest echo chamber of small-town Oklahoma was a wide world of people doing weird and interesting things: traveling the world, writing poetry, having kinky sex, discussing Kurt Vonnegut, posting artful self-portraits, talking about socialism and their favorite way to cook tofu.

<br/>
And they were all on Livejournal.

<br/>  
I’d always considered myself open-minded and progressive. I was raised to believe in equality, that women could do anything men could do, that men weren't entitled to women's bodies. Then I stumbled into an unexpected world: a den of Livejournal feminists. They posted risqué selfies. They celebrated their “muffin tops.” They talked openly about sex. And they didn’t shave their body hair. This was a whole new level.

My initial, unintentional reaction was disgust. Then, disgust at my own disgust. 

<br/>
Alongside my belief in equality, there existed a deep and previously unexplored misogyny I didn't even realize was there. 
  
<br/>
These women weren’t living their lives to impress men. This seemed revolutionary to me, which I would come to realize spoke volumes about the weight of toxic masculinity that I carried with me. I began to recognize my own internal biases. I came to see the power of this community of women empowering one another.

Then I saw the way many men responded. Hostility. Policing women's bodies. All of society's expectations of women being thrown at them in the comments section. I felt shame. I took a good long look at myself.

<br/>
Was this how men felt entitled to treat women who didn’t look or act or smell the way they were "expected" to? 

<br/>
The internet answered with a resounding “yes.”
