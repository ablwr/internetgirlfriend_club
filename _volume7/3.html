*Geocities is an early internet history that needs no introduction to anyone over 30 or anyone having done any casual browsing in this space. Geocities was the most well-known and well-established of the '90s web hosting sites. There's been plenty of work already done on Geocities, [attempts to save it](https://archive.org/web/geocities.php) before it nearly-suddenly disappeared from the internet, many mirrors of what could be salvaged on the live web, and [ample research and restoration work](http://blog.geocities.institute/).*

Eddie & I have been together 2 years as of February 20, 2000.  We met in our Sophomore PE class when we were 15 years old because we both refused to "participate" in the class. We didn't like each other like "that " until we were 17.
