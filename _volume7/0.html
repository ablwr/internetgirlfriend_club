Hello!

I mentioned [last volume](/volume6/0.html) that I'd be shifting to something different for the next volume-or-two-or-three, and I am shifting to showcasing examples from different early-web websites, and introducing them with a little bit of historical context in each.

Many of these personal websites (and their communities) have been lost to time *like tears in the rain*. These reasons are varied: some were removed intentionally, while others were sold, shutdown or transferred indefinitely. Because some of them relied on server-side technology for search and retrieval, uncovering them today becomes difficult (the content is there, but bringing it to the surface requires prodding and digging).

This volume contains some [oversharing](/volume7/1.html) and some [moderate sharing](/volume7/2.html), a [couple's page](/volume7/3.html) and [not-so-couples page](volume7/4.html), [poetry](/volume7/5.html), and a belated [Valentine's Day wishlist](volume7/6.html).

Hope you enjoy this variation on the theme, inspired partially by personal [temporary time constraints](https://www.recurse.com/) and partially by needing [more submissions from YOU](/cfp). I am still very much collecting submissions for a triumphant return to the traditional webzine format, so please please please [submit](/cfp)!!!

ðŸ’™,

Ashley
