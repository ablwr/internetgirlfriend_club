“You have to see this,” she said. The girl who would become my lifelong best friend and I were working a
long, slow shift in the basement of the college library.

It was a black web page with a centered gray frame with a picture of [a guy from our school](http://web.archive.org/web/20020805043200/http://www.makeoutclub.com:80/03/boysframe.html), Reed
Richards (Not his real name!), and a text box with Smiths lyrics and a list of bands on the right. I scrolled up and down the
page, and it was full of other gray frames with other pictures and other lists of bands or lyrics or
interests or straight edge affirmations or jokes or random thoughts, along with contact information on
ICQ, AIM, and Email.

“What is this?”

<br/>
“MakeoutClub,” she said.

I kept clicking the numbers at the bottom, and more pictures kept showing
up. Pictures of the kinds of people we’d see at the Black Cat, where she, 21, would buy something purely
alcoholic, and I, 19, would buy a coke, and we’d sneak into the bathroom and mix our own drinks. Or the
kinds of people we’d say hi to at the cafeteria at school where I, with too much of a meal plan, would
give her a swipe in and we would pile our plates high with a giant salads doused in blue cheese.

MakeoutClub became a little obsession for a few months. We would look in to see if Reed Richards had
changed his profile. Once he showed up at a party we were at. He was handing out daisies to women
and calling them beautiful. Totally tipsy, I ran up to him and said, “I saw you on MakeoutClub!” I did not
get a daisy. That night he made out Sue Storm (Not her real name!) on the couch. I think they got married a couple years
later.

I later uploaded my own profile to MakeoutClub. But because this was before selfies, the only digital
photo I had of myself was from my cousin’s wedding the summer before. I was wearing a short, bright
pink Hawaiian print dress from a department store. I was smiling. It was not right at all for Makeout
Club, but it was all I had. I only got messaged once. It was a mass message from a band, but I messaged
him back anyway. I know. We met up at show we were both going to anyway. It was the band, [The
Anniversary](https://web.archive.org/web/20010301165011/http://www.theanniversary.net/). He gave me his band’s CD. He was fine.
