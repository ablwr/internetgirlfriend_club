*Hey! Hey! It's finally here, Volume 1 of Internet Girlfriend Club, and I am super super psyched!! Not just for this but for future volumes! This inaugural volume covers an assortment of teen feelings -- of [revisiting first-love]((/volume1/1.html)), [imagination vs reality](/volume1/2.html), [isolation](/volume1/2.html), [boredom](/volume1/4.html), [cattiness](/volume1/5.html), and [rejection](/volume1/6.html). It also features a large amount of archival material, not only embedded in [a nostalgic masterpiece](/volume1/3.html) but thanks to [Blogspot](/volume1/2.html), [Livejournal](/volume1/6.html), and [an instant messenger service](/volume1/5.html). Please [keep 'em comin'](/cfp); I can't wait to share more stories!*

*Your loving editor, Ashley*
