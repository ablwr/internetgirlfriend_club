Hello!

I mentioned [last volume](/volume6/0.html) that I'd be shifting to something different for the next volume-or-two-or-three, and I am shifting to showcasing examples from different early-web websites, and introducing them with a little bit of historical context in each. So many of these entire communities and personal website hosts have been significantly lost to time, for various reasons -- intentionality, websites shutting down, websites being sold and transferred, or websites that were run using server-side technology that make current discovery difficult (meaning that the content is there, but is difficult to surface).

Hope you enjoy this variation on the theme, inspired partially by personal [temporary time constraints](https://www.recurse.com/) and partially by needing [more submissions from YOU](/cfp). I am still very much collecting submissions for a triumphant return to the traditional webzine format, so please please please [submit](/cfp)!!!

ðŸ’™,

Ashley
