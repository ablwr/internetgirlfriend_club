### About

**This is a web-zine about teen love on a very different internet.**

This is about being a teenager and this is about love (or... something) and this is about an internet connected using phone lines.

This is a project by [Ashley Blewer](https://ashleyblewer.com), using the third-person and royal "we."

### Technology

- Built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
- Using [overkyll-jekyll-theme](https://github.com/bertrandkeller/overkyll-jekyll-theme) as the base theme

After starting this project, I have been informed of others, similar in ethos, and they are pretty great. Please check them out:

### Even more

If you really really love this project and don't know how to handle it, consider donating to the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/donate/), as the creation and decoration of this website has relied heavily on [GIFCities](https://gifcities.org/?q=) and the [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/). Also of interest and worthy of [support](http://rhizome.org/support/donate/) is [Rhizome](http://rhizome.org/) (in general) and their [oldweb.today](http://oldweb.today/) platform (in specific).
