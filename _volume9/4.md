When I was a kid, we didn't have the internet at home. 
![note](/assets/img/lightning-banner.gif){: .center} 
My mom would drop me off at the public library and I would use the internet there. 
![note](/assets/img/lightning-banner.gif){: .center} 
There was a special room set up with eight computers.

It was a room with glass on three sides so that the librarian could see what we are doing.

I would check my email or just "surf".

One time when I was at the library using the computer, 
![note](/assets/img/lightning-banner.gif){: .center} 
there was a man using the computer next to me. 
![note](/assets/img/lightning-banner.gif){: .center} 
He had moved the browser window to make it one long thin line and he was scrolling very slowly.

He was looking at porn but only through a tiny window so he wouldn't get caught. 
![note](/assets/img/lightning-banner.gif){: .center} 
He saw me looking at his screen and knew I was looking at him look at porn, 
![note](/assets/img/lightning-banner.gif){: .center} 
so he tried to stare at me but I did not look in his direction again. 
![note](/assets/img/lightning-banner.gif){: .center} 
I wanted to move but you have to wait to use a computer, 
![note](/assets/img/lightning-banner.gif){: .center} 
so I didn't and I kept browsing until my two hours were up, 
![note](/assets/img/lightning-banner.gif){: .center} 
trying to not look in that direction again.
