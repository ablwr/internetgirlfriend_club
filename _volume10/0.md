Hello hello hello!

Wow, Volume 10 of Internet Girlfriend Club is here, just in time for [Brood X to infiltrate our aural space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brood_X) this Spring. In some ways, it's surprising that this zine has made it to Volume 10, and at the same time I am still as greedy and hungry as ever to hunt down stories from this short-lived [internet era](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1L2xODZSI4). So thank you to everybody who has submitted something in the past-- I hope that Volume 11 will be only just around the corner.

If you're looking for some other thoughts on this era, I caught this [Interview with Charli XCX and Jia Tolentino](https://www.dazeddigital.com/life-culture/article/52535/1/listen-to-a-future-world-podcast-with-jia-tolentino-and-charli-xcx-social-media) that touches on Angelfire, MySpace, early private-not-private journals, and the concept of performance.

Hmm, there isn't a clear theme in this volume. We have a mix of stories and primary sources here and I'm not able to come up with a specific theme. There's the tension between [online and offline](/volume10/1.html), some [longing and listening](/volume10/4.html), [sweet misunderstoods of youth](/volume10/3.html), and a [hi-how-are-you email](/volume10/6.html). There's a very nice [longform journey](/volume10/5.html) heavily involving online discovery of self and identity, and a [short commentary](/volume10/2.html) on teen love.

Please please [submit your stories or MSN messenger logs or printed-out angelfire sites](/cfp), or encourage your friends, family, enemies, and everyone else around you to do the same! As always, I beg you!

Your editor, Ashley
