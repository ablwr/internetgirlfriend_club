**FioFio5:** hi you  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** yo  
**FioFio5:** yo  
**FioFio5:** what's shakin?  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** nothin  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** how are you  
**FioFio5:** okay  
**FioFio5:** you?  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** awful  
**FioFio5:** oh?  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** yeah  
**FioFio5:** in what sense?  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** i just feel like shit  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** in the typical rené way  
**FioFio5:** that's really too bad  
**FioFio5:** is there anything I can do?  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** not really  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** unless you can take my exam and go on tour as me 
![bar](/assets/img/heartline7.gif){: .center}  
**FioFio5:** Hmmmm  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** and such  
**FioFio5:** I would fail your exam for you  
**FioFio5:** and I really can't pass, as much of a groupie I am  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** uh huh  
**FioFio5:** if I could, I would be you for however long you like, so you can go curl in bed with a book and some tea  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** i just wanna hop on a train and go  
**FioFio5:** go where?  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** i dont care  
**FioFio5:** why do you want to leave? what are you trying to get away frokm?  
**FioFio5:** \*from  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** just things that make me sad. but in the end thats gonna follow me anywhre, so i i'm not goin anywhere.  
**FioFio5:** true....  
**FioFio5:** what is making you sad? (you don't have to talk about this if you'd rather not)  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** i'm on a big let down from the last few weeks i guess  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** i just feel ashamed of/disappointed with myself this week  
**FioFio5:** why?  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** cuz i'm not as happy with a lot of shit as i should be  
**FioFio5:** who says how happy you should be? happiness is variable  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** it sure is  
**FioFio5:** something that usually makes you happy can't always do it  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** i;m not very happy with us right now. and i'm very ashamed of that.  
**FioFio5:** I know you're not  
**FioFio5:** but it's nothing to be ashamed of  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** yes it isw  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** its so vain of me  
**FioFio5:** vain?  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** and selfish  
![bar](/assets/img/heartline8.gif){: .center} 
**FioFio5:** well....  
**FioFio5:** I don't know  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** yeah. me either.  
**FioFio5:** I just don't think you should really let it bother you too much. Either it will pass or it won't. If it does, then it's not a problem. If it doesn't, well... you get the idea  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** yeah  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** i guess  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** its just that its stuff i knew would bother me. but stuff that i feel doesnt bother you as much, so it makes me feel like i'm not being fair  
**FioFio5:** like what  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** like the distance  
**FioFio5:** well of course that bothers me  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** and i'm growing more and more convinced that its a permanent issue  
**FioFio5:** Mmmm  
**FioFio5:** I didn't choose to go on leave.  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** what do you mean?  
**FioFio5:** I haven't talked to anyone about this, not my family, no one.  
**FioFio5:** because I'm very ashamed about it all.  
**FioFio5:** I was placed on leave  
**FioFio5:** hence why no one, not even me, knew I wasn't coming back this semester until the last minute  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** wow  
**FioFio5:** and I can't come back next semester, because it's set at at least a year.  
**FioFio5:** so.  
**FioFio5:** that's the deal.  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** um ok  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** well  
**FioFio5:** so if you want to call it quits right now, I will not be surprised  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** why didnt you tell me any of this?  
**FioFio5:** well, my pride was part of it.... but also I didn't know what would happen with us. I didn't know if we'd last long enough  for it to matter.... but ovbiously it has. and I'd been very torn as to when and how to tell you, but I decided, oh, this weekend I  suppose, that I have been completely wrong in not telling you right at the start. it's just really hard to tell someone something that will without a doubt change everything, and not for the better. I've just been so happy and swept up with you, I didn't want to do anything to ruin it. But I guess you can only ignore reality for so long.  
**FioFio5:** and I hate life, I hate how it does things like this.... gives you an amazing person while in an impossible situation  
**FioFio5:** so now you know what no one else does... and of course you're the one most affected by it... and the one who should have known all along.  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** i love you so much fiona.  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** but how can i trust you?  
**FioFio5:** I don't know  
**FioFio5:** I don't know.... I can't express how sorry I am  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** holy shit  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** i cant believe this  
**FioFio5:** I wish it weren't true  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** yeah me too  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** i'm sorry, but i cant remember the last time i was lied to on this scale  
**FioFio5:** I would say that I never said I'd be back next semester... but I don't think I can really say anything to help.  
**FioFio5:** I can't think of anything to say that you could believe  
**FioFio5:** I was about to say that I love you... but that might be hard to believe to  
**FioFio5:** Ugh.  
![bar](/assets/img/heartline9.gif){: .center} 
**FioFio5:** Maybe it would just be better if I didn't say anything at all.  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** i dont know  
**FioFio5:** of course, not saying anything is how I got into this mess... hell, it's how I screwed up last semester.  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** if youd told me all of this, it wouldnt have mattered to me, dont you know that?  
**FioFio5:** how could it not have matter... knowing that I couldn't come back next semester, as much as I would like to?  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** it wouldnt have changed how i feel about you. being lied to however is very disturbing.  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** no matter how much you want to come back  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** when exactly did you decide you were gonna tell me this  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** last weekend?  
**FioFio5:** I wish I were a more eloquent person so I could better describe what I want to say.... I regret not telling you about this, lying, covering it up, more than any decision I've ever made. I can't believe how selfish I've been in not sharing it with you.  
**FioFio5:** Well, I always knew I had to tell you, I'm not that horrible... but I truly realized just how much I've wronged you last thursday  
**FioFio5:** and this weekend just pounded it in some more  
**FioFio5:** and it's been all I can think about since leaving sunday  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** geez  
**FioFio5:** it's why I've been in such a poor mood all week  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** is it just by necessity that you waited the night before tour to tell me? i mean, this is gonna be ridiculous.  
**FioFio5:** no  
**FioFio5:** you think I thought, "hey, the night before tour would be a great time to tell him??"  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** no  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** i'm thinkin you put it off as late as you could  
**FioFio5:** and I'm thinking that no good time existed except back in January  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** but at the same time, i now have to go off on the road and not talk to you for a while  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** did that have anything to do with it?  
**FioFio5:** NO  
**FioFio5:** god no  
**FioFio5:** I've had too many people tell me bad things at the worst times. I would never time it that way for someone by choice.  
**FioFio5:** especially not someone I love!  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** i'm sorry  
**FioFio5:** you have NOTHING to be sorry about  
**FioFio5:** I'M sorry  
**FioFio5:** is there a word that means "so sorry you would do anything to go back and do it right"?  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** i just feel like i'm not being as sensitive to what a big deal this is for you as i should be  
**FioFio5:** what do you mean?  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** i mean i'm beiong selfish again.  
**FioFio5:** no you're not... not at all  
**FioFio5:** I'm shocked you're even talking to m e 
![bar](/assets/img/blackredbar.gif){: .center} 
**Potsdamerplatz33:** how could i not?  
**FioFio5:** I think a lot of people would have said, "well, Fiona, that's nice. now fuck off."  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** i cant do that  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** but i am hurt. deeply.  
**FioFio5:** I am so terrible sorry  
**FioFio5:** I feel so miserable  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** me too  
**FioFio5:** I can't believe I'm trying to relay emotions like these over a stupid computer  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** i cant do the phone right now. i cant handle that.  
**FioFio5:** I feel like I'm coming across differently than I feel... I feel like it looks like I'm just saying things to say them  
**FioFio5:** that's fine  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** i'm sorry, i'm not being very good at talking  
**FioFio5:** it's fine  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** what do you want from me right now?  
**FioFio5:** I don't think I have any right to want or ask for anything from you.  
**FioFio5:** just don't stop talking to me... please  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** i'll do my best  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** i wish i didnt have an exam tomorrow morning  
**FioFio5:** I'm so sorry  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** i just dont want to do anything to make this any harder for you than i'm sure it already is  
**FioFio5:** what do you mean by that?  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** i mean i know this isnt an easy position to be in, so i wanna do what i can to make you feel better, but at the same   time, i'm still hurt and i've lost my trust.  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** so i dont know what to say/do  
**FioFio5:** I don't want you to try to make me feel better  
**FioFio5:** I want to know how you're feeling and what you're thinking... that's all  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** right now i want to be able to not think about this at all....with the exam and tour and all comin up. but i know   that its all i'm gonna be thinkin about the whole time  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** and i dont want to  
**FioFio5:** I'm so sorry for that  
**FioFio5:** what do you see happening?  
**FioFio5:** what do you want to do?  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** ah geez  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** i'm an expert at stalling and not making decisions cuz i usually end up regretting them  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** my vision for the future is very hazy. i just dont know whats going to happen.  
**FioFio5:** well, that's why it's the future  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** at the moment i feel like i need us to be apart for a while. thats why i'm bad at makin decisions, cuz thats the   kind of decision i know i'm gonna regret.  
**FioFio5:** alright  
**FioFio5:** apart it is, then.  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** i'm afraid thats only gonna make both of us miserable  
**FioFio5:** I think I'm going to be miserable no matter what  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** but i dont know if i can be happy with myself just letting this go  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** i dont want you to be miserable  
**FioFio5:** I already am... I can't be anything but miserable... I've hurt you, so so much.  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** i know its not meant that way, but that makes me feel responsible. i really must have some intense masochistic need   to be the one doing the hurting.  
![bar](/assets/img/blackredbar2.gif){: .center}
**Potsdamerplatz33:** i'm just crazy  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** tell me what to do to make you less miserable  
**FioFio5:** there is nothing that you can do! I'm feeling horribly guilty (like I ought to) for hurting you. for hurting someone I care   about desperately.  
**FioFio5:** okay  
**FioFio5:** I thought of something  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** ?  
**FioFio5:** you could try to get some sleep and do well on your test and enjoy tour  
**FioFio5:** that would make me feel better  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** i'll do it. as long as it really makes you feel better. cuz i'll talk to 6am too if thats what you want.  
**FioFio5:** when I said not to stop talking to me, I meant in general... not right this minute  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** ok  
**FioFio5:** I don't want to make your test tomorrow any worse than I already have by keeping you from sleep  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** i do have to get up early to pack anyway  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** i guess we'll talk again when i get back wednesday  
**FioFio5:** guess so  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** i'm sorry fiona. whether you think i should be or not.  
**FioFio5:** well  
**FioFio5:** I accept your apology, even though i don't understand it  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** good enough  
**FioFio5:** I'm so sorry that this had to happen  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** me too  
**FioFio5:** and even more sorry that it had to be you  
**FioFio5:** I can't tell you how much you mean to me  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** we'll see where this goes. maybe i'll be able to grow up and deal with this.  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** either way, i promise to keep talking  
**FioFio5:** I think you're far more grown up than me.  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** meh  
**Potsdamerplatz33:** goodnight anyway. i love you.  
**FioFio5:** I love you so much  
**FioFio5:** try to get some good sleep  
**FioFio5:** and good luck with everything
