*Author's note: The story behind Austin is that I met him and two other kids (Marla and Gump) in an ICQ chat room. The only other thing I remember is that Gump was from Vancouver. We chatted that summer and then I totally lost touch with them. I tried to find Austin online, but I have no idea what happened to him. Not a terribly exciting story.*
