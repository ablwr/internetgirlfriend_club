STACY

Time awakens Me

Gentle palm fronds dance in the midnight sky. A gentle wind stirring them into a dance. Fog rolling across the earth gliding over barren hills, swirls creeping like a silent predator. The fog blankets the earth in a opaque vale blinding the moon of its love. The jealous moon weeps its splendor, its blue rays gestures caught in the fog. Impenetrable calm weaves across the hills as he fog silences the night. The earth is held captive from the moon. Tonight they do not dance. Tonight the moon sleeps alone. Suffering broken and distraught the moon is helpless fore he is too far away to stop the fog. However the moon understands he is partly to blame because he controls the movements of the oceans. When he shifts the ocean stirs and the fog rises. Oh but he cries deep moans of sorrow despite this knowledge. He cannot prevent his feelings, feelings rushing impulsively like that of battle hardened infantry. Infantry whose cries push weaker comrades into war. Following each other in a paceless surge, blundering forward, a parade of fools marked only by stupidity and devotion. They cannot stop themselves from this rush, they were trained only to follow orders. To be blind and naïve, never questioning judgement only to flow like a raging torrent.
Still he cries each weep a glimpse of her radiance slips away from his sight. With every push forward the moon, whose swollen eyes, brow and cheek clenched like fists, vice grips squeezing tears they drift to the earth. The moon watches them slip away never to be claimed by anyone. The fog with fat greedy fingers tucks her away slowly. Agonizing chills crack his whimpers a painful cold jolts his senses.

Finally the shroud eclipses all of her beauty. A hallow moan embraced with a cavernous sigh travels through the peaceful calm. Fore the moon realizes in this deep sorrow that he is saved by his memories. Oh, sweet memories!

“Thank you so! For these memories”

These are uttered words by chapped lips not heard by anyone. They like his moans become forgotten gestures. With these memories dreams are enlightened and sparks can flare once more. He has something to look forward to…


Each day I can dream. Each day I will think of you a million times. I will remember our dance. I will remember every kiss, I will walk where we have embraced. I will have conversations that will remind me of you. As I grow old I will hold our memories close to my heart. With you I shared so much in so little time. Time with fleeting fury escaped our grasp but time has been preserved and secretly stows away in my dreams. There I will wait patiently holding everything in this void for you to return. I pray that greedy time will not pry my memories from me. I will try to escape time. Avoid its blundering indulgence, and relive our memories… I still love you Stacy! I cannot help the way I feel. I have tried to stop this but love laughs at my silly attempts to bar and recede it. I have never felt so deeply for anyone in my life, and it’s so difficult for me to let go.

If the fog should clear… I ask you now for one more dance… I promise to sweep you away and forever bring you happiness.
Love,
Jeff Schmidt
