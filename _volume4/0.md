Volume IV is here and it's a medley! We have a [chopped'n'screwed video essay](/volume4/1.html), a [two](/volume4/2.html)-[part](/volume4/3.html) tale of love and betrayal (among other things) presented as a primary source, an [angry email](/volume4/4.html) to a hateful website, some [reflections on being a 13-year-old webmaster](/volume4/5.html) (What was up with teen girls circa 2000 and their obsession with .nu domains?), and a [quick late-night teen chat](/volume4/6.html).

I want to shout out this game, [Black Room](https://cass.itch.io/blackroom), by [Cassie McQuater](http://www.cassiemcquater.com/). I feel it really captures something so true and so pure, an essential oil of this time period. The music is soothing, too, and you can leave it running as you leisurely traverse through this volume.    

Just like I say every time: please, please, please [contribute](/cfp). Keep this going! I depend on you!  

Your editor, Ashley
