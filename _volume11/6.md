I met someone from madradhair on livejournal and we talked for a few months before dating. our relationship fizzled based mostly around the fact that I didn't have the money to make a move at the time (i was like 20 and couldn't even afford a car at the time) and she'd met someone at work. She and I are still friends though and shortly after she broke up with that co-worker she confessed to me that the guy **[redacted]**
