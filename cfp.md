### Submission Deadlines

Next chapter submission deadline is June 30, 2017!

### Submission Guidelines

{{ site.title }} is seeking former Generation Y2K internet girlfriends and boyfriends and whateverfriends to share informally their experience as teenagers or young adults on the world wide web.

Submissions can be in the form of a text narrative, illustration, interview, photography, audio/video, or anything else you think would be suitable. Performance art (audio, video, dance, instructional), whatever, we'll figure out how to make work. Submissions featuring (or exclusively consisting of) primary sources are very very welcome!

*Topics of consideration and points of inspiration may include, but are certainly not limited to:*

- True love
- Fake love
- Cybersex
- Experimentation with identity
- AIM/ICQ/MSN Messenger/Chatroom logs
- Meeting someone from the internet for the first time
- Illustration of yourself as a teenager hovering over a computer waiting for someone to message you back, etc.
- Extremely expensive and unexpected phone bills
- Lies you told in middle school
- Getting dumped on the internet
- Getting grounded because of the internet

### Submission Outline

- Title  
- Story or links to other material
- Name, or fake name, or total anonymity request.

### Submission Restrictions

- The narrative must have taken place on an internet that existed earlier than 2004.
- Submissions should be informal (like talking to a friend), but formality (e.g. academic analysis) is okay too. E.g., text narratives need not be verbose -- 200 words will do, although longform submissions are also welcome. Just letting you know, this is chill.

### Submission Conclusions

Accepted submissions will be delicately wrapped in code by hand and released as chapters. If selected, you will be notified upon publishing and have the right to retract. You own the content.

**Privacy**: You can also submit anonymously or with a nom de plume. However, this makes things a little tricky when retaining ownership or if I need to ask you if everything is OK. You can either navigate this complexity via setting up privacy/security on your side, or by accepting that the things you submit without a return-to-sender will be accepted as open to a [CC0 license](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/).

### So...?

If you'd like, you can email ashley.blewer, courtesy of gmail. For private submissions in which I also do not know who sent this narrative, manage your security appropriately and [reply via this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeUqrFZoeRduZqeyEQsAPUoXb7SddRmQ2XmalXkym_29-P2gw/viewform?usp=sf_link).
